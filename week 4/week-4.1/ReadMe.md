# Week 4.1 DOM Introduction

- The DOM (Docuement Object Model) API is a programming interface for web documents.
- It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM represents the document as a tree of objects, each object represents a part of the page.
- JavaScript is a implementation of ECMAScript, Document doesnot come with ECMAScript rather it is an API provided by the browser to parse the html document.
- The ECMAScript standard was orginally intended for a standard use cases script language. but the people how made web browser took the ECMAScript standard and made JavaScript but it lacked some key functionalities such asynchronous fetching, setting time intervals and timeouts. So They implemented these functionalities seperately and provided to JavaScript as Web APIs.
