### Backend in Next.js
- Next.js is a full stack framework.

- This means the same server handles the frontend and backend request.
- Next.js allows us to maintain a single codebase for our application rather than maintaining seperate codebase for frontend and backend which we used to do with MERN.
- This also ensure that there are **no CORS issues**, as same domain name is for both backend and frontend.
- This also makes deployment easier, we only have to deploy a single codebase, where as on MERN, we have to deploy both frontend and backend seperately.
