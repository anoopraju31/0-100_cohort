# Databases
- Databases are organized collections of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. 
- They play a crucial role in managing and organizing large volumes of information in a structured way.

### types of databases:
1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS):** 
    - Use tables to store data and relationships between them.
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database
2. **NoSQL Databases:**
    - Designed for flexible and unstructured data storage.- Examples: MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra.
3. **Graph Databases:**
    - Designed to store and process data in terms of entities (nodes), relationships between entities (edges), and properties associated with both nodes and edges.
    - Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and OrientDB
4. **Vector Databases:**
    - Vector databases are specialized databases designed to efficiently store, search, and retrieve high-dimensional vector data.
    - Examples: Milvus, Milvus, and Milvus

In This course we will be focusing **MongoDB** and **Postgres**.
