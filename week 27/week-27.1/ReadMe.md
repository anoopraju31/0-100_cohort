### What is kubernetes

- **Kubernetes** (popularly known as **k8s**) is a *container orchestration engine*, which as the name  suggests lets you create, delete, and update *containers*.
- This is useful when:
    - You have your docker images in the docker registry and want to deploy it in a cloud native fashion.
    - You want to not worry about patching, crashes. You want the system to auto heal.
    - You want to autoscale with some simple constructs.
    - You want to observe your complete system in a simple dashboard.
