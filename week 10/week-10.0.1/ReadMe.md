### Types of Databases
- Databases are divided into 2 types -
    1. SQL - Structured Query Language
        - SQL databases, also known as **relational databases**, are a type of **database management system (DBMS)** that organizes and stores data in a structured format using **tables**, **rows**, and **columns**. 
        - They have a strict schema.
        - They are very hard to change schemas, and involves migrations
    2. NoSQL - 
        - NoSQL databases, as the name implies, are databases that depart from the traditional relational model and do not necessarily use SQL as their primary query language.
        - These databases are designed to handle various types of unstructured, semi-structured, or highly distributed data at scale.
        - They are schemaless databases.
        - They are faster to produce apps.
