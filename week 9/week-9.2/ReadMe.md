### Types of Languages (Strongly typed vs loosely typed)
- The terms **strongly typed** and **loosely typed** refer to how programming languages handle types, particularly how strict they are about type conversions and type safety.

| Strongly Typed                            | Loosely Typed                             |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Variables have a fixed type               | Variables can be change types             |
| Type checking is enforced at compile-time | Type checking is enforeced at runtime     |
| Stricter codebase                         | Faster to bootstrap                       |
| Lesser runtime errors                     | high chances for run time errors          |
| Examples: C++, Java, Rust                 | Examples: Javascript, Python, Perl, php   |
