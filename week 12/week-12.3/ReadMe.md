# Week 12.3 | Actionable Docker

`Note`: This a short actionable introduction to Docker. This will help us get started with running packages locally and gives us a taste of what Docker can do.

## Contents:
- [**Installation**](#installation)
- [**Verification**](#verification)

### Installation
Docker can be installed using the Docker GUI, which simplifies the setup process. Detailed instructions for various operating systems can be found on the official Docker documentation website at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.

### Verification 
After installation, we should verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the `docker run hello-world` command. This command will pull the "hello-world" image from Docker Hub and run it in a new container, which should print a message to the terminal.
